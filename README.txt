Warmap - A Afghanistan/Iraq War Log to Topic Maps converter
===========================================================


What is Warmap?
-----------------
Warmap converts the WikiLeaks War Logs (Afghanistan War Diary and
Iraq War Logs) into Topic Maps. Further, it provides utilities to 
extract information from the reports independently of Topic Maps.


Getting started
---------------
Even if you don't know Topic Maps or don't care about Topic Maps, Warmap
can help to extract useful information from the reports. Several 
modules like are independent of Topic Maps and provide a convenient 
interface to the report information.

To get started with Warmap, look into the ``warmap.core`` package.


Disclaimer
----------
Warmap is not a WikiLeaks mirror and has no ties to WikiLeaks. 
It uses war reports which are already widely available on the web.
